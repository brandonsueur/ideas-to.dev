# ideas-to.dev

A simple way to find ideas to develop. A lot of beginners looking for ideas to progress or developers who want to show their skills on GitHub.

This is why I created [ideas-to.dev] (https://ideas-to.dev)! 🚀❤️

## Summary

- ⚡️ Fast and light (no need to say it because it has to be but it's still important to say it, it's SELLER).
- 🔒 I am not selling your data.
- 🚀 A small API made with Laravel 6.
- 💰 Completely free 

## 🤝 To contribute, it's very simple!

Take your inspiration and add your ideas to help others make plans to progress. 👌

1. Propose an PR, by simply expressing your idea and you will have the honor of appearing under the idea.
2. I have to validate from a small administration.
